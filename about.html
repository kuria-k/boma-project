    <h1>STORY</h1>
    <p>
      The word "Boma" means "enclosure" or "homestead" in many African
      languages—a place where people gather, share stories, and break bread.
      That spirit of togetherness is what inspired the founding of Boma. Founded
      in [insert year], Boma began as a humble dream: to create a space where
      the rich tapestry of African flavors could be experienced under one roof.
      From the smoky aroma of nyama choma to the comforting warmth of jollof
      rice, our menu is a journey across the continent—crafted with love,
      memory, and a deep respect for tradition. What started as a small
      family-run kitchen has grown into a beloved culinary destination, known
      for its authenticity, hospitality, and heart. But no matter how far we go,
      we’ll always stay true to our roots.
